# Nodemusicapp
 Nodejs music application by using expressjs framework and mongodb database. User can upload their music files into the system. (Maybe google drive functionality will be added). While uploading music file, application gets the music metadata. If there isn't any metadata available for a music file, then user can be update music details later. You can also change the selected track by clicking another track from the music list.
